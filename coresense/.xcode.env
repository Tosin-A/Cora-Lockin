#
# Customize the NODE_BINARY path here.
# For example, to use nvm with brew, add:
# export NODE_BINARY=$(brew --prefix nvm)/nvm.sh && nvm use default && which node
#
# Or to use a specific version of node:
# export NODE_BINARY=/path/to/node/bin/node

# Or to use the system node:
export NODE_BINARY=$(command -v node)
